eurovision-words
================

This is a project that I started because I thought the lyrics of all Eurovision songs were so ... corny. eurovision-words will parse lyrics from http://www.diggiloo.net/ and sort them by word occurrence. 

Dependencies:
 - gem install nokogiri
 - gem install httparty

To run:
```bash
bash> ruby eurovision_words.rb outputfile.txt
```
